The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The focus is to predict the the risk of Coronary Heart Disease over a 10 year period.

This Project is still in development and I will be trying to train multiple ML models over the data and perform a comparative evaluation of their accuracy. The final model can be exported and used independently to predict results for new data.
